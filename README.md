# ðŸ”® LLM-based Astrologer Recommendation Engine

This project was originally developed as part of a real-world hiring challenge in the astrology domain. It demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) and semantic similarity can be used to build intelligent recommendation systems.

The system takes a user's chat transcript or profile as input and recommends the top 3 matching astrologers based on relevance â€” with an open-source AI astrologer module for fun!

Iâ€™ve open-sourced and polished it further as part of my learning journey and portfolio building.
